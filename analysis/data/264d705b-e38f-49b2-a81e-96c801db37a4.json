    "description": "Crypto Alpha Hunt is your AI-powered crypto hunter, specifically designed to identify early-stage moonshot tokens. By analyzing real-time multidimensional data (market trends, on-chain activities, and social sentiment) with quantitative algorithms, it detects high-potential assets at their early breakout stage and pinpoints optimal pullback entry opportunities.\n\nSimply click Run to start the task — the Agent will launch in the cloud and continue running automatically. If a token with an upward trend is detected, you will receive an email alert. Please note: each token alert is sent only once, so don’t miss the opportunity.\n\nThe Agent is billed at 6 credits per hour once running. If you do not wish to continue incurring charges, please Terminal the session to stop it.",
